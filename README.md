# AppleScabFDs Dataset

A dataset of apple images showing healthy fruits and fruits infected by scab, collected from different locations in Latvia.

## Dataset Description

The AppleScabFDs dataset is designed for apple scab detection tasks. It contains images grouped into two categories: "Healthy" and "Scab". This dataset is suitable for image classification, transfer learning, and developing mobile applications for plant disease detection.

- **Categories**: Healthy and Scab
- **Image sources**: Smartphone cameras (12 MP, 13 MP, 48 MP) and a digital compact camera (10 MP)
- **Collection conditions**: Field conditions in orchards

## Data Collection

- **Location**: Various locations in Latvia
- **Collection time**: Images were taken at three different stages of the day:
  - Morning (9:00-10:00)
  - Around noon (12:00-14:00)
  - Evening (16:00-17:00)
- **Lighting conditions**: Both sunny days and overcast days to provide different types of light (soft light and hard light)
- **Composition**: Leaves were framed to occupy the image area as much as possible and centered in the image
- **Multiple perspectives**: The same object was photographed from multiple viewpoints

## Applications
